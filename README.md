Build a service in Kotlin (using Spring Boot) that exposes a REST interface with an in-mem DB and with an unpolished frontend built in React or Angular that is capable
storing objects of some kind that can be submitted from the frontend. The service should be 
containerized and runnable without use of any external services. Spend no more than a max of 
15 hours on it.
