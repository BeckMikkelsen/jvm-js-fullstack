Task:

Build a service in Kotlin (using Spring Boot) that exposes a REST interface with an in-mem DB and with an unpolished frontend built in React or Angular that is capable
storing objects of some kind that can be submitted from the frontend. The service should be 
containerized and runnable without use of any external services. Spend no more than a max of 
15 hours on it.

Notes:
This is simple wish List generator written in kotlin. It stores the items on the wish list in a mongo db. You add items by by writing a name and using the number of ! as priority of the item. You can delete items from the list by simply clicking on them. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to get docker up and running. Therefore, the service has not been containerized. I hope that you can teach me more on this subject.
